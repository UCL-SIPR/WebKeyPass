UCL WebKeyPass

A simple web application for storing passwords and other pieces of
information about servers.

The servers and their virtual machines can be categorized (e.g. by
operating systems). A hierarchy is displayed in a side panel. Misc nodes
can also be added. This can be useful for licenses, web sites, databases
or other things.

To access the data, a login is necessary. There is a form to create a
user. A user can be a normal user or an admin. Admins have access to an
admin zone, where they can activate or edit other user accounts, and see
a log of logins/logouts by month.

The Symfony 2 PHP web framework is used. This repository contains only a
bundle.
